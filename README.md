# Artblog
***
This is intended to be portfolio and blog application for art-focused work.

It should have the ability to make entries and view them in a blog-like format, as well as to submit images to albums.  

It may eventually also include a shop front, capable of displaying items for sale and allowing secure transactions to purchase said items.  However, I have no plans of implementing that until after the core of the app is in a usable state.  

This project is very much still in development.  It is not yet in a state where it's ready for use.
