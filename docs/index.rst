Welcome to Artblog's documentation!
===================================

This is a blog project for those who need a art-centric platform.

At the moment, it's mostly just boilerplate code, but that should change
in the coming weeks!

This project is still in development, and is not ready to be used.

If you'd like to use the boilerplate to work on development yourself,
check out the :doc:'requirements' and :doc:'quick_start'!
