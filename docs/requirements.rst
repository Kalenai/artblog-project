Requirements
============

For development, this project is using the following:

-Oracle VM VirtualBox and Vagrant (optional, but takes care of all the rest)
-python3
-pip3
-virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper
-Firefox (for Selenium tests)


Using Vagrant may make your life much easier.
If you'd like to do so, you can get VirtualBox from here: |virtualbox_download|.

Then, download Vagrant from here: |vagrant_download|.

.. |vagrant_download| raw:: html

    <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">Vagrant</a>

Note that if you use the Vagrant route, you shouldn't need the rest of the requirements.
They'll be installed on your VM when it sets up.  Feel free to just skip ahead to the quick start!


If you do choose to avoid Vagrant, for whatever reason, continue on with the rest of the requirements.

Python can be downloaded here: |python_download|.

Firefox can be downloaded here: |firefox_download|.

Installing pip3, virtualenv, and virtualenvwrapper can be a pain depending on your system.
I would recommend Google-ing for instructions for your preferred operating system.
